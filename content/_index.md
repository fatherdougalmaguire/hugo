<div style="margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:1em;">
As a teenager, I spent a lot of my free time mucking about with the <a href="projects/microbee/">family's home computer.</a>
</div> 
<div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">
I built a bunch of cool things ( since lost to the ages )
</div> 
<div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">
Life ( as it is want to do ) takes you different places and coding fell by the way side.
</div> 
<div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">
In recent times,  I have wanted to pick up the baton again and get my head around how things have changed.
</div> 
<div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">
A few projects have been bubbling around in my mind and I wanted to document what I will be doing so things don't ( once again ) fall down the back of the metaphorical couch.
</div> 
<div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">
I thought about a YouTube channel.  And then a podcast.  
</div> 
<div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">
Recognising that I would be terrible at either of these options, I quickly came to my senses and decided that a blog might be the way to go.
</div> 
<div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">
These pages will attempt to track my journey into this new world.
</div> 
<div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">
I'm concentrating on three main projects at the moment.
</div> 
<ul>
  <li><a href="/projects/microbee/">Microbee</a> - Revisiting a computer from my youth by way of a emulator.</li>
  <li><a href="/projects/corewars/">Corewars</a> - Programs battle for supremacy inside a virtual computer. </li>
  <li><a href="/projects/blogging/">Blogging</a> - Using Jekyll to build my own blog.</li>
