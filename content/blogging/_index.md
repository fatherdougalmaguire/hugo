I thought it my be a good idea to track the progress of my various software projects by way of a blog.


Mainly as I am notoriously bad at documentation.
But also give me a way to track my progress.
Or lack thereof. 

This then begs the questions:

1. How do you build a blog ? 
2. Where to host it ?
3. How much will it cost ?

Given that this is a vanity project,
cost became the prime consideration.
After all, zero dollar options were the easiest to justify to my nearest and dearest.
So it then becane a decision on whether I went with a turnkey solution like [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com "Google Sites"), start from scratch or find some happy medium in-between. 


I became somewhat frustrated with Google Sites as I couldn't style it the way I wanted ( notwithstanding I had access to an unused instance just hanging around) .
Starting from scratch seemed to be a fool's errand.
I didn't know one end of a CSS from another and the last time I created a web page, the **BLINK**{ tag was de rigueur.

Then I stumbled across my goldilocks solution.

A *static site generator (SSG)*.

For those not familar with the term, an SSG takes fixed textual content, applies an HTML template to it and generates web pages.
The resultant pages are uploaded to a hosting site and bob's your uncle, you have a blog.

And because you can choose different HTML templates, you can achieve a multiplicity of output styles without having to know much about web design.


My software projects use GitHub to host their source code.
As part of a GitHub account, I have access to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.git.com "GitHub Pages").

You get one site aligned to your GitHub username ( known as a "user site" ) and any number of subsidary sites ( known as "project sites" )
And a number of SSG solutions are supported.
I chose <a href="www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as my starting point as it seem to have the largest user community.
And GitHub Pages supports Jekyll out of the box.

As much as I dislike the phrase "journey", as I build out my blog, I'll post some explanation of what I did along the way in the hope it may be of use to someone.

Or a cautionary tale of being sucked into the [futzing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/futz "futzing") swamp.
