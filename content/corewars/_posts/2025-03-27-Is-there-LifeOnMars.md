I had made abortive attempts at building MARS environments for the [Microbee](\microbee) ( and later the PC ) but nothing ever came to fruition.  

So I decided to bite the bullet and finally complete one.

My implementation is called [LifeOnMars](https://github.com/fatherdougalmaguire/LifeOnMARS "LifeOnMars GitHub repository")

It is written for MacOS Sonoma ( v14.0+ ) using Swift/SwiftUI.

It is more of a UI framework at this point but it will serve as a testbed for code patterns required for my other projects.
