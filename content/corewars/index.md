I first read about CoreWars in old back issues of Scientific American.

And I was hooked.

CoreWars pits two programs ( written in simplified programming language called RedCode ) against each other in a virtual computer ( called MARS or Memory Array Redcode Simulator )

Each program battles each other in attempt to stop the other executing and essentially win the battle.

Within this framework, these programs ( or warriors ) need to rely on complex strategies to defeat their opponents.  

Further,  genetic programming can be used to evolve warriors without human intervention.

I decided to roll my own MARS environment as my second major project.
