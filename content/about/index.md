Contrary to what the the site title may lead you to believe, I am not an Irish priest living in exile on a windswept island.

I live in Sydney, Australia and work for the technology arm of a large financial institution.    

That being said, my skills are more technology adjacent.  
So when it comes to HTML/CSS/JS et al,  I am entirely self-taught.

Which will become pretty obvious if you page through the blog,

On the plus, I do own a beautiful black cat.
